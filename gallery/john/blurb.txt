<h2>John Darrell : paintings in oil</h2>
<p><b>A selection of recent works</b></p>
John’s oils are very exciting to us all here, and although his gift for light and shadow, reflections, and the changing, flowing, and quickly passing moods of our natural environment are not captured as spectacularly in web format as they are in his original paintings, we hope you will nevertheless feel as moved and inspired by his work as we do.  Please also check back frequently: John is painting all the time, and we hope not only to add to his gallery of recent works, but also soon to present a gallery of some of his earlier paintings, drawings, studies and sketches as well.
